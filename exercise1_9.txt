SICP Exercise 1.9

First procedure:

(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (6))))
(inc (inc (7)))
(inc (8))
9

This is a recursive procedure. The inc action is deferred until it is the only thing left to perform.

Second procedure:

(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9

This is an iterative procedure. a and b are state variables, with simple rules for changing their state, and a terminating condition. The interpreter only has to keep track of a and b to carry out the process.
