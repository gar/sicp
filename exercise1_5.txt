; SICP Exercise 1.5

(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y) (if (= x 0)
                       0
                       y))
(test 0 (p))

If the interpretor is using normal-order evaluation, it will try to expand all the operands before evaluating the procedures. In the case of '(test 0 (p))', it would try to evaluate '(p)' and end up in an infinite loop. If applicative-order evaluation is being used, the 'test' procedure would just evaluate to '0' without the need to expand '(p)'.
